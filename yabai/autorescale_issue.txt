I was looking for a way to automatically rescale the padding when entering clamshell mode. Unfortunately, I couldn't find this feature in Yabai, so I created an alternative method (thx gpt). If Yabai officially supports this function, please let me know!


### 1. Check the external monitor resolution
 You can check the resolution using either the Yabai command or a shell command.

a. Using Yabai command:

    yabai -m query  --displays 

b. Using Shell command:

    system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType 

### 2. Create an Auto Rescale Script
Make sure to change the desired_resolution to match your external monitor's resolution. The format should be "width x height", and the spacing must be exactly the same.

**`autorescale.sh`**
```sh
previous_resolution=""
desired_resolution="3840 x 2160"    # Change to your external monitor's resolution

while true; do
    # Fetch current resolution
    current_resolution=$(system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType | grep Resolution | awk '{print $2, $3, $4}')

    # Check if the resolution has changed
    if [ "$current_resolution" != "$previous_resolution" ]; then
        echo "Resolution change detected: $current_resolution"
        if [ "$current_resolution" = "$desired_resolution" ]; then
            # If yes, run the Yabai commands
            yabai -m config top_padding 34 ....
        else
            echo "Resolution is not 3840 x 2160, skipping configuration changes."
            yabai -m config top_padding 5 ....
        fi

        # Update previous_resolution
        previous_resolution=$current_resolution
    fi

    # Wait a bit before checking again
    sleep 5
done

```     


### 2.  Run the Script in the Background
 Use the nohup command to run the script in the background. The script checks for resolution changes every 5 seconds.

    nohup ./PATH/autorescale.sh &

### 3. Update the script
To update the script, first find the PID of autorescale.sh:

    ps aux | grep autorescale.sh

Then, kill the process (for example):

    kill 25632

After the process has been terminated, return to step 2 to restart the script.
